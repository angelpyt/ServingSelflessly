##### 2. Project Description ####
> Our Serving Selflessly project utilizes all the material and skills we have learned this quarter. We implement aspects from challenges and in-class coding practices. For our website, our main purpose is to allow users to look up non profit organizations in the U.S on a map. We did this using data from Pro Publica's Non Profit Explorer API. The API provides data on over 1 million organizations in the US. Our website would've loved to showcase all the data that was provided however due to limited storage and access to Google's Geocoding API (2,500 requests/day), our website was only able to showcase a total of 2,250 organizations. However, our idea and purpose of our website does not change.
